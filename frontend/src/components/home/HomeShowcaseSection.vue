<!--
  Conversion-oriented section that replaces the old "Supported Providers"
  block on the homepage. Renders TWO visually-separate sub-blocks:

    1. (Optional) "活动" — <HomePromoBanner /> when an active recharge
       campaign exists. The banner is loud and self-contained, so we do
       NOT prepend a redundant section title above it.
    2. "订阅套餐" — <PlanPlazaCards :max-items="3" :view-all-href="..."/>
       gets its own labelled header so the two blocks read as distinct
       offers rather than one merged block.

  GUARDS:
    - `payment_enabled === false` → entire section is hidden. Plans are
      payment-only and the campaign is a recharge promo, so when payments
      are globally off neither block has a meaningful CTA.
    - Promo fetch failure → silent skip (console.warn only). The plan grid
      still renders. We never `toast` on the public homepage.

  RED-DOT POLICY: Per product decision (#5), the homepage banner does NOT
  surface the recharge-promo red dot — that affordance lives on the
  authenticated `/purchase` page only. We deliberately do NOT call
  `useRechargePromoDot` here.

  TEST CONTRACT: The outer `<section data-test="home-showcase-section">`
  hook MUST be preserved — `HomeShowcaseSection.spec.ts` asserts on it
  for both the visibility guard and the banner/cards stub presence.

  <!--
    Visibility composition:
      Outer section requires payment_enabled AND something worth showing
      (loading skeleton, an active promo, or at least one plan card).
      The "nothing worth showing" case—payments are on but admin hasn't
      configured any plan AND there's no campaign—must collapse the entire
      block, otherwise the homepage gains an empty `mb-16` slot between
      the features grid and the footer.

      Loading is intentionally treated as "worth showing" so the plans
      grid's skeleton renders during the initial fetch; otherwise users
      on slow connections would see the section pop in late, after the
      hero, in a way that visibly shifts the page.

    <!--
      Block 1: 活动 banner with its own labelled header ("活动专区").

      Why a header now:
        Originally the banner shipped with an inline "限时活动" eyebrow
        and was loud enough to stand on its own. That inline eyebrow has
        been retired (corner ribbon carries the limited-time cue), so
        we promote the section title up to a centred header — same
        visual register as the 订阅套餐 block below it. This keeps the
        two offerings clearly delineated and gives the banner a textual
        category anchor for screen-reader users.

          Section subtitle — mirrors the structure of the plans block
          subtitle so the two headers read as a matched pair. Copy is
          intentionally scarcity-coded (limited window / limited slots /
          stack the bonus) rather than the plans block's volume-discount
          framing.

      Block 2: 订阅套餐 — own header, clearly separated from the banner.

      Hidden entirely when there are no plans to show. The cheaper
      alternative would be to keep the header and let `PlanPlazaCards`
      render its "暂无套餐" empty state, but on the marketing homepage
      that reads as "this product has nothing for sale" — actively
      anti-conversion. We'd rather collapse the block silently and let
      the promo banner / features grid carry the page. Users who want
      to see plans will still find them via the "Pricing Plaza" nav
      link or the hero CTA, both of which route to `/plaza/plans` where
      the empty state is contextually appropriate (they explicitly
      opted in).

      `loading` is part of the gate so the skeleton state still paints
      during the initial fetch; otherwise quick-loading clients would
      see no plans block, then a flash-in once the API resolves.
